# INTRODUCTION TO PREDICTIVE MODELING

# Examples where predictive modeling can be useful
# Movie recommendations based on gender, age, sex, past movies etc
# Predicting the stock price etc
# Predictive modeling is using past data to predict future data

# Identifying factors responsible for Sales reduction - This is detective analysis rather than predictive modeling since
# no future forecast is involved

# TYPES OF PREDICTIVE MODELS
# Supervised Learning - A definite target variable is available from the historical data which can be used to predict
# future data Ex: House price prediction. The house price may be dependent on the locality, number of rooms, area etc

# Un-Supervised Learning - No specific target variables are available. Data are segmented based on the commonalities
# and the differences between each other. Ex: Google News grouping, segmentation of the customers etc

# Types of Supervised Learning - Target Variables are Continuous values (Regression) vs Discrete Values (Classification)
# UnSupervised Learning - Classic example is market segmentation.. Like segmenting customer base in to
# High Salary - High Spend, High Salary - Low Spend, Low Salary - High Spend, Low Salary - Low Spend

# STAGES OF PREDICTIVE MODELING

# Process of Predictive Modeling can be divided in to six stages
# 1 - Problem Definition
# 2 - Hypothesis Generation
# 3 - Data Extraction from all possible sources
# 4 - Data Exploration and Transformation
# 5 - Predictive Modeling
# 6 - Model Deployment / Implementation

# Problem Identification: Identifying the right problem, and formulating the problem mathematically
# Bad Problem Statement: Want to improve the profitability of credit card customers
# Reason: The above goal can be achieved in many different ways. Like, increasing the APR of the credit cards, or
# having different APR and benefits for different customer segments, or identifying customers with low default rate
# A problem statement should have a straight forward specific goal
# Good Problem Statement: Want to predict the default rate of customer (All the above defined possibilities rely
# on the customer default rate. Hence, predicting the default rate is more straight forward goal / prob. statement

# Hypothesis Generation: Listing down all possible variables, that might influence problem objective

# Let us analyze all the possible factors that might affect the above problem statement:
# Income: Higher Income people might have lower default rate
# Job Type: Person with a stable job might have a lower default rate
# Credit History: Previous repayment behavior can have an impact on future payment behavior
# Education: Educated people have better understanding of credit products, and may have lower default rate

# Hypothesis Generation should be done before looking at the data to avoid any bias
